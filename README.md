# LeetCode

In this repository I'm going to solve some problems published on the site: https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/

## 1. Two Sum
Given an array of integers ```nums``` and an integer ```target```, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to ```target```.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Input:** nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9

**Output:** [0,1] (*Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]*)

## 2. Add Two Numbers

You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Input:** l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]

**Output:** [7,0,8] (*Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807*)

## 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string ```s```, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

Input: s = "abcabcbb"

Output: 3 (*Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3*)
